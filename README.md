- 👋 Hi! My name is Mike, a life long learner (imalifelonglearner). I'm a physicist by training and recently I earned my MBA. I really enjoy learning more about finance and data analysis. I also like marketing. What I like most in life is solving problems, however. I like finding solutions to problems. I've been doing that as a manager for the last ten years. Just solving managerial problems like developing and coaching teams to be more prouctive. I want to return to something more quantitative; like data analysis using statistics. Anyway, that's all for now.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python3 at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 on Cognitive.ai
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything at the moment. Anything were I can learn more about coding in python3, finance, marketing, and statistics.
- 📫 How to reach me? I believe you can leave a message here on GitHub.
